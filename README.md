**THIS GOES WITHOUT SAYING, PLEASE DON'T USE THIS IN PROD EVER.**

I'm trying to learn some crypto and concurrency for fun with Scala
and this is a public playground documenting my work. This will
likely be riddled with security holes (PRs welcome!) and is NOT
suited for production. Ever. Never roll your own crypto, and even
worse, never ever use Kevin's crypto.
